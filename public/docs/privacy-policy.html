			<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
			<p><strong>Last updated: 9th February, 2025</strong></p>

			<section>
				<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
				<p>
					This Privacy Policy explains how
					<strong>Job Seeker</strong> ("we", "our", or "us") collects,
					uses, stores, and protects your personal information when
					you use our Chrome extension ("Extension"). By using our
					Extension, you agree to the collection and use of
					information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
				<p>
					Our Extension requests access to your Google account data
					using the following scopes:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>Google Sheets Access:</strong> The scope
						<code
							>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets</code
						>
						allows our Extension to see, edit, create, and delete
						your Google Sheets spreadsheets. We use this solely to
						save job-related data that you choose to store.
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>Google Account Email:</strong> The scope
						<code
							>https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email</code
						>
						allows us to read your primary Google account email
						address for user identification purposes.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					No other personal data is collected, stored, or processed by
					our Extension.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
				<p>
					We use your information solely for the following purposes:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						To authenticate your identity via your Google account.
					</li>
					<li>
						To save and manage your job application data by
						appending job details into your designated Google Sheet.
					</li>
					<li>
						To ensure that the correct user data is updated in the
						appropriate Google Sheet.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
				<p>
					<strong>Storage:</strong> All job data is stored in the
					Google Sheet specified by you during the setup process. We
					do not maintain any separate servers or databases for this
					information.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Security:</strong> Access to your Google data is
					managed through Google&apos;s OAuth2 mechanism. All data
					transmissions between your browser and Google&apos;s
					services are encrypted (using HTTPS). We take reasonable
					measures to protect your information, but no method of
					transmission over the Internet is 100% secure.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>5. Third-Party Disclosure</h2>
				<p>
					We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal
					information to outside parties except as necessary to
					provide our service (i.e., using Google&apos;s APIs).
					Google&apos;s own privacy practices apply to data stored in
					your Google Sheets.
				</p>
			</section>

			<section>
				<h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
				<p>
					You may revoke the Extension&apos;s access to your Google
					account at any time via your Google Account settings or by
					removing the Extension.
				</p>
				<p>
					For any questions or concerns regarding our privacy
					practices or to request deletion of your data, please
					contact us at:
					<a href="mailto:[akshaybennyajh@gmail.com]"
						>[akshaybennyajh@gmail.com]</a
					>.
				</p>

				<h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
				<p>
					We may update our Privacy Policy periodically. Any changes
					will be posted on this page with an updated “Last updated”
					date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy
					periodically for any changes.
